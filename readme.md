This template gets you set up with everything* you need to get started on a pattern library.

## Set up
In order to run this pattern library genrator correctly you'll need to follow a couple of steps.

1. `$ gem install jekyll` — If you don't already have jekyll on your machine.
2. `$ npm install` — To get all the dependencies for grunt.

## Running the project
Just simply execute `grunt` or `grunt:serve` and the project will build itself, set up a server, open the library page and wait for you to make changes.

## Building the project
Once you're happy with everything, run `grunt:build` and it will compile, minify and compress everything ready for production. Pop the repo on your server and get it to point to the `web` directory, job's a good-un.
